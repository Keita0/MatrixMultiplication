# MatrixMultiplication
GSLC1 - Object Oriented Programming
The matrix multiplication application is designed to take input from the user to determine the dimensions of the two matrices that need to be multiplied. The user will be prompted to enter the number of rows and columns for each matrix.

Once the dimensions are provided, the program will check if the two matrices are compatible for multiplication. For matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the second matrix. If the two matrices are not compatible, an error message will be displayed indicating that the multiplication is not possible.

If the two matrices are compatible, the program will proceed to perform the multiplication. The resulting matrix will have the same number of rows as the first matrix and the same number of columns as the second matrix.

The program will then display the resulting matrix on the screen for the user to see. The output will show the values of each element in the matrix, formatted in rows and columns.

The matrix multiplication application will be efficient and able to handle large matrices. It will also be user-friendly with clear instructions and error messages to guide the user through the process.
